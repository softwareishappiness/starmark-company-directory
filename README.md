# Starmark Company Directory 

This code challenge was created with [Angular 5](http://www.angular.io) and
[Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/). 
The following components were created for this implementation:

- Starmark Employee Application `<app-starmark>` and `app.component.ts`
- Starmark Directory Component`<app-starmark-directory>` and `starmark-directory.component.ts`
- Starmark Employee Component `<app-starmark-employee>` and `starmark-employee.component.ts`
- Starmark Employee Service `starmark-employee.service.ts` 
- Starmark Employee Interface `employee.ts` 
- Alpha Pipe `alpha.pipe.ts` 
- City Pipe `city.pipe.ts` 
- Pairs Pipe `pairs.pipe.ts` 

## Success Criteria 

Improve user experience (UI/UX):

- Streamline the user experience by providing additional employee information inline rather than navigate away from directory listing 
- Hyperlink email, phone and location so that email may be sent, VoiP calls may be made and location found on Google Maps 

## Production Environment 

For your convenience I have deployed a virtual host to demo the Starmark Company Directory at:
http://starmark.softwareishappiness.com

## Development Environment 

- Follow instructions for [Getting Started](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) so that you may install Angular 5 and CLI.
- After run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Then run `ng serve --open` to launch a development server. A browser window will open and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
